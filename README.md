## Problem Statement:
> The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured 
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete 
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test 
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and 
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we 
need for acceptable compressive strength.

## Approach: 
>We have used classical machine learning regression algorithms to predict the strength of the conrete mixture.

# Language Used:
>Python 3.x
